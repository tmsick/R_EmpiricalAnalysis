# R Empirical Analysis

This is a prettified version of `R_EmpiricalAnalysis` data suite provided alongside the book [R による実証分析](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274219474/).

Directories are renamed so that they include only ASCII characters excluding space, and all the files

-   are encoded in UTF-8;
-   use `LF` as newlines, not `CR+LF`; and
-   end with a single newline

and all the R files

-   are formatted by [R Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mikhail-Arkhipov.r); and
-   have the extension of upper case `R`.
