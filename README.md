# R Empirical Analysis

This is a prettified version of `R_EmpiricalAnalysis` data suite provided alongside the book [R による実証分析](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274219474/).

Directories are renamed so that they include only ASCII characters excluding space, and all the R files are:

-   encoded in UTF-8 (this applies to CSV files as well);
-   formatted by [R Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mikhail-Arkhipov.r);
-   trailed by a single newline; and
-   given the extension of upper case `R`
